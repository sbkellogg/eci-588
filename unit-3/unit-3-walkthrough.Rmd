## 0. INTRODUCTION

The Unit 3 walkthrough extends previous research and evaluation work by myself and colleagues at the Friday Institute. Specifically, this work was aimed at understanding and improving peer interaction and discussion in the Friday Institute's Massively Open Online Courses for Educators (MOOC-Ed) and Online Professional Learning programs.

### Walkthrough Focus

This week will be our first introduction to the "Model" process our out data intensive workflow introduced in Unit. Our focus will be on identifying "topics of

For Unit 2, our walkthrough will cover the following topics:

1.  **Prepare**: Prior to analysis, it's critical to understand the context and data sources you're working with so you can formulate useful and answerable questions. We'll take a quick look at Dr. Rosenberg's study as well as data available through Twitter's API.
2.  **Wrangle**: In section 2 we revisit tidying and tokenizing text from Unit 1, and and learn some new functions for appending sentiment scores to our tweets using the AFFIN, bing, and nrc sentiment lexicons.
3.  **Explore**: In section 3, we use simple summary statistics and basic data visualization to compare sentiment between NGSS and CCSS tweets.
4.  **Model**: While we won't leverage modeling approaches until Unit 3, we will examine the mixed effects model used by Rosenberg et al. to analyze the sentiment of tweets
5.  **Communicate:** Finally, in Week 7 we'll create a basic presentation, report, or other data product for sharing findings and insights from our analysis.
