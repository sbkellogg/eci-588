## 0. INTRODUCTION

This week, our walkthrough is guided by my colleague Josh Rosenberg's recent article, **Advancing new methods for understanding public sentiment about educational reforms: The case of Twitter and the Next Generation Science Standards.** We will focus on conducting a very simplistic "replication study" by comparing the sentiment of tweets about the [Next Generation Science Standards](https://www.nextgenscience.org) (NGSS) and [Common Core State Standards](http://www.corestandards.org) (CCSS) in order to better understand public reaction to these two curriculum reform efforts. I highly recommend you watch the quick 3-minute overview of this work at <https://stanford.app.box.com/s/i5ixkj2b8dyy8q5j9o5ww4nafznb497x>

### Walkthrough Focus

For Unit 2, our focus will be on using the Twitter API to import data on topics or tweets of interest and using sentiment lexicons to help gauge public opinion about those topics or tweets. Silge & Robinson nicely illustrate the tools of text mining to approach the emotional content of text programmatically, in the following diagram: Â

This chapter shows how to implement sentiment analysis using tidy data principles."){width="90%"}](https://www.tidytextmining.com/sentiment.html#sentiment)

For Unit 2, our walkthrough will cover the following topics:

1.  **Prepare**: Prior to analysis, it's critical to understand the context and data sources you're working with so you can formulate useful and answerable questions. We'll take a quick look at Dr. Rosenberg's study as well as data available through Twitter's API.
2.  **Wrangle**: In section 2 we revisit tidying and tokenizing text from Unit 1, and and learn some new functions for appending sentiment scores to our tweets using the AFFIN, bing, and nrc sentiment lexicons.
3.  **Explore**: In section 3, we use simple summary statistics and basic data visualization to compare sentiment between NGSS and CCSS tweets.
4.  **Model**: While we won't leverage modeling approaches until Unit 3, we will examine the mixed effects model used by Rosenberg et al. to analyze the sentiment of tweets
5.  **Communicate:** Finally, in Week 7 we'll create a basic presentation, report, or other data product for sharing findings and insights from our analysis.
