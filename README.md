# **ECI 588: Text Mining in Education**

[**Course Overview**]{.underline}**:** As the use of digital resources continues expand in education, an unprecedented amount of new data is becoming available to educational researchers and practitioners. Among these new data sources, unstructured data such as text represents a significant share. This introductory course to text mining is designed to prepare researchers and practitioners to use this data more efficiently, effectively, and ethically. This course will provide students with an overview of text mining as an analytical approach, examples of its use in educational contexts, and applied experience with widely adopted tools and techniques. As participants gain experience in the collection, analysis, and reporting of data throughout the course, they will be better prepared help educational organizations understand and improve both online and blended learning environments.

[**Number of Credits**]{.underline}**:** 3

[**Course Prerequisites/Co-requisites**]{.underline}**:** ECI 586, Introduction to Learning Analytics, is recommended, but not required prerequisite for this course.

[**Meeting Time**]{.underline}**:** This distance education course is predominantly asynchronous. Online tools are utilized throughout the course for communication and interaction. In addition, we may use Zoom for real-time web conferencing, virtual office hours, or whole class discussions. Occasional live sessions will be held as a time agreeable to most students and otherwise recorded for playback by anyone unable to attend. Generally, I assume you'll spend 5 to 7 hours per week working on class assignments. Since learning online and/or using programming tool like R may be a new experience for your, please plan ahead to set aside the time you'll need to be an active participant in the course.

[**Virtual Class Locations**]{.underline}**:** This course will be taught online through NC State's *Moodle* course management platform. Access <http://wolfware.ncsu.edu/> and log-in with your Unity ID and password. After logging-in, locate and click on ECI 588 to access the course site.

Your Google Drive provides "an infinitely large, ultra-secure, and entirely free bookbag for the 21st century."  This space may be useful for your project work, or you may use a third-party Internet service provider to place your data files and projects online (e.g., [Github](https://github.com/), Dropbox). In addition, Moodle provides space for storing private files.

[**Course Goals**]{.underline}**:** Goals for the Text Mining in Education course are guided by the North Carolina State University motto: *Think and Do.* Specifically, goals for this course are twofold:

1.  **Disciplinary Knowledge.** Students will deepen their understanding of text mining as an emerging approach within the field of Learning Analytics, including its application in a wide range of education settings.

2.  **Technical Skills.** Scholars will develop proficiency with the processes, tools, and techniques necessary to efficiently, effectively, and ethically apply text mining to understand and improve learning and the contexts in which learning occurs. 

[**Student Learning Outcomes**]{.underline}**:** The following learning objectives are aligned with the overarching learning objectives of the Graduate Certificate in Learning Analytics program and are embedded in each unit of the course. Student who complete this course will be able to:

1.  **Conceptual Foundations:** Describe key text mining concepts, terminology, legal and ethics issues and how text mining has been applied to address important problems, questions, and issues in education;

2.  **Data Sources & Measures:** Identify and appropriately use education data sources for text analysis (e.g. student essays, online discussion forums, etc.) and associated measures (e.g. term frequency, tf-idf, etc.);

3.  **Tool Proficiency:** Efficiently and effectively apply up-to-date software and tools (i.e. R or SAS Text Analytics) to implement text mining workflows for preparing, analyzing, and sharing data;

4.  **Processes & Techniques**: Understand and apply text mining approaches and techniques (e.g. text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, topic modeling) in order to understand and improve learning and the contexts in which learning occurs; and, 

5.  **Communication:** Clearly communicate methods, analyses, findings, and recommendations that can provide actionable insight into learning contexts for a range of education stakeholders.

[**Major Assignments & Assessment**]{.underline}**:**

1.  **Housekeeping (4 pts)**: Students will review Syllabus sent at the beginning of the semester that outlines expectations for participating in an online course. Student will also be required to install necessary software and post a brief introduction of themselves and respond to their peers.

2.  **Readings & Discussion (24 pts)**: The first week of each unit consists of required and self-selected readings and resources introducing terminology, core concepts, and applications of text mining in education. Students will log in throughout week and engage in informal discussion with other members of our learning community. To help guide discussions, students are provided a set of guiding questions to address and are also encouraged to explore their own areas of interest.

3.  **Guided Walkthroughs (24 pts):** During the second week of each unit, students gain hands-on experience with text-mining tools and processes using R and RStudio. Week 2 consists of guided tutorials and resources that will introduce students to reading and wrangling data for analysis, exploring data for interesting patterns or trends, and reporting data in a reproducible way. Full credit will be provided for successful completion of tutorials.

4.  **Independent Analysis (24 pts):** In the final week of each unit, students will be asked to apply their knowledge and skills by conducting an independent analysis of either an instructor provided or self-selected data set utilizing the techniques demonstrated in readings and walkthroughs.

**5.     Final Course Project (24 pts)**: In the final week of each unit, students will create a report or data product on an analysis they conducted using an instructor provided dataset or a data source of your choosing. Product or report will include key finding and insights gained from the analysis.

[**Grading Scale**]{.underline}**:** The grading scale is based on 100 points:

A+ (97-100), A (94-96), A- (90-93), B+ (87-89), B (84-86), B- (80-83)

C+ (77-79), C (74-76), C- (70-73), D+ (67-69), D (64-66), D- (60-63), F (59 or less)

Assignments submitted by the due date may be revised and resubmitted for a higher grade by the following week. Full credit is not awarded for late work unless permission is received from the instructor. Late work may be penalized at 15% per week it is late.

[**Course Structure & Schedule**]{.underline}**:** This course is divided into four units focused on conceptualizing Learning Analytics as a research discipline and developing the foundational skills for data exploration. Week 1 of each unit introduces terminology, core concepts, and applications of Learning Analytics through readings, course videos, and discussion. In week 2, we focus on developing the technical skills necessary for exploratory analysis through various software tutorials. In week 3, students will apply these skills to conduct a self-directed analysis and create a data product using an educational dataset provided or a dataset of their own choosing.
